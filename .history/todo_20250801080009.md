## Review Section

### Latest Changes Summary
1. **Fixed ExamGradingScreen compilation errors**: Corrected method calls to use proper DAO methods (`userDAO.get()` instead of `userDAO.getUserById()`, `examTypeDAO.get()` instead of `examTypeDAO.getExamTypeById()`)
2. **Fixed double comparison issues**: Removed `!= null` comparisons for primitive `double` types, using `> 0` instead
3. **Updated todo.md**: Reflected current priorities and marked completed tasks
4. **Prepared for CRUD implementation**: Ready to implement Examiner and Candidate user management within Admin role

### Security Best Practices Verified
- ✅ No sensitive information exposed in frontend
- ✅ Proper error handling without exposing system details
- ✅ Input validation implemented
- ✅ Role-based access control maintained
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials or API keys
- ✅ Proper session management structure in place

### Next Steps
1. Implement ExaminerManagementScreen for Admin
2. Implement CandidateManagementScreen for Admin
3. Implement ExamResultsScreen for Candidate
4. Update AdminDashboardScreen navigation to include new CRUD screens
5. Test all new functionality thoroughly
